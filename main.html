    <p>  <h1>The Wise Man.</h1>


He created the feeling of unhappiness in others.

But one day, when he turned eighty years old, an incredible thing happened. Instantly everyone started hearing the rumour:



Mediavine


“An Old Man is happy today, he doesn’t complain about anything, smiles, and even his face is freshened up.”



The whole village gathered together. The old man was asked:

Villager: What happened to you?



“Nothing special.
 Eighty years I’ve been chasing happiness, and it was useless.
And then I decided to live without happiness and just enjoy life. That’s why I’m happy now.” – An Old Man



Moral of the story:
Don’t chase happiness. Enjoy your life.<br>
